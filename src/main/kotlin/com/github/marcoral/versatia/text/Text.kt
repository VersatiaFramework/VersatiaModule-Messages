 * Registering and parsing are safe on any thread, but the built-in presentations read Bukkit state

     *
     * In the text a brace inserts the value's component. Inside an argument of a tag, where
     * MiniMessage reads a plain string, `<click:suggest_command:'/msg {player.name} '>`,
     * `<insert:{player.name}>`, `<color:{c}>`, it inserts the value's plain text, escaped for the

     * argument holding a brace is quoted. The text of `<hover:show_text:...>`, which MiniMessage
     * parses again, keeps the component.
     *
     * A text without braces and without tags registered with [tag] gives the same component every
     * time, so it is parsed once and reused until a tag is registered.
