/**
 * The messages of one plugin, read from the YAML files under `messages/` in its data folder and
 * reloaded with it. Every plugin gets its own instance by injecting this type. A file whose name
 * starts with a dot holds no messages; `messages/.versatia.yml` holds settings. Each load logs a
 * warning through the plugin's logger for every message with legacy colour codes (`&a`, `§l`),
 * naming the MiniMessage tags to use instead, unless that file sets `legacy-color-warnings: false`.
 * See https://versatiaframework.github.io/VersatiaDocs/docs/modules/messages.
